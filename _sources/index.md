# Confused Compute

I'm a computer scientist and physicist passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, learning, and teaching. I'm particularly interested in agriculture tech, the biomedical fields, and any work that can improve our well-being as humans.

After earning a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Warwick, I worked as a postdoc at Princeton University. I have spent the last six years in industry, working as a data scientist.

I was born in France, and have lived in several different countries. I love reading, mostly fantasy and science fiction, but also philosophy and technical literature. I'm an avid cook and bread baker, and a scotch aficionado. I'm also a photographer and amateur radio operator.
