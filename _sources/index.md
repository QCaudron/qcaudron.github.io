# Quentin Caudron

I'm a computer scientist and physicist passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, learning, and teaching. I'm particularly interested in agriculture tech, the biomedical fields, and any work that can improve our well-being as humans.

Professional
I'm currently a Principal Data Scientist at CBRE, where I lead a team of data scientists working in forecasting revenue scenarios under COVID-19, analysing digital user behaviours using unsupervised learning, and bringing modern computational methods to engineers and stakeholders alike.

Academic
I attended the University of Warwick, in the UK, as a Bachelors of Chemistry student with a minor in Management.

I then joined the Centre for Complexity Science, where I earned a Masters in Complexity Science and a PhD in Computer Science in the field of mathematical neuroscience, under Dr. Yulia Timofeeva. I developed algorithms to compute the filtration properties of dendritic trees as a function of their morphologies.

I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in Bryan Grenfell's group, studying the predictability of epidemics in small populations. During my postdoc, I also created and delivered courses in scientific computing for the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering.

I've also collaborated widely, on things like building image processing algorithms for automated histology, analysing antibiotic consumption, studying malaria transmission dynamics, and building remote-sensing hardware for mouse field studies.

Personal
I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland, Russia, and Canada. I've really enjoyed seeing some beautiful places and sampling different cultures (and food !).

I love reading, mostly fantasy and science fiction, but also philosophy and technical literature. I'm an avid cook and bread baker, and a scotch aficionado. I'm also a photographer and amateur radio operator.









I'm a data scientist and lapsed physicist. My interests are in machine learning, signal and image processing, and theoretical biology.

I like thinking about methods and algorithms for solving complex problems.
I work for the Market Builder Group within CBRE, the world's largest commercial real estate services company. We're a data analytics team, building business solutions around vast quantites of data using open-source technologies.

Prior to joining CBRE, I built mathematical and statistical models of disease dynamics at Princeton University, as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience from the Centre for Complexity Science at the University of Warwick in 2013. I was affiliated with the departments of Physics, Computer Science, and Biological Sciences, and was part of the Computational Biology and Bioimaging Group. Before that, I received an MSc in Complexity Science in 2009, and a BSc in Chemistry in 2008. I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland and Russia.






I'm a passionate scientist with an interdisciplinary, technical background, combining academic curiosity with industry best practices. I greatly value mentorship and collaborative team-building, creative solutioning, transparency, and personal growth. In terms of industries, I'm particularly interested in biomedtech, agtech, and space.

Before researching statistical and computational methods in epidemiology at Princeton University, I earned a PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience and a MSc in Complexity Science at the University of Warwick. 

I am the founder and organizer of the award-winning Advanced Topics on Machine learning ( ATOM ) discussion group in Seattle. Whilst at Princeton, I founded the Princeton University Python Community, and taught workshops on scientific computing for the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering. 

My interests are in applied mathematics, signal and image processing, and machine learning.
