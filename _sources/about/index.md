# About

I'm a passionate scientist with an interdisciplinary, technical background, combining academic curiosity with industry best practices. I greatly value mentorship and collaborative team-building, creative solutioning, transparency, and personal growth. 


## Professional

I'm currently a Staff Data Scientist with [Granular](https://granular.ag/), where I develop models, informed by remote sensing, that help farmers better manage their operations and adopt more environmentally-friendly practices that sequester carbon.

Prior to joining Granular, I spent five years at [CBRE](https://cbre.com/), where I lead a team of data scientists working in forecasting revenue scenarios under COVID-19, analysing digital user behaviours using unsupervised learning, and bringing modern computational methods to engineers and stakeholders alike.


## Academic

I attended the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), in the UK, where I graduated with a Bachelors of Chemistry with a minor in Management, with Honours.

I then joined the [Centre for Complexity Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/), where I earned a Masters in Complexity Science and then a PhD in Computer Science in the field of mathematical neuroscience, under [Dr. Yulia Timofeeva](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~yulia/). I developed algorithms to compute the [filtration properties of dendritic trees](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57056/) as a function of their morphologies. 

I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)'s [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.princeton.edu/) in [Bryan Grenfell](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/bryan-grenfell)'s group, studying the predictability of epidemics in small populations. During my postdoc, I also created and delivered courses in scientific computing for the [Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/about/about-picscie).

I've also collaborated widely, on things like building image processing algorithms for automated histology, analysing antibiotic consumption, studying malaria transmission dynamics, and building remote-sensing hardware for mouse field studies.

## Personal

I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland, Russia, and Canada. I've really enjoyed seeing some beautiful places and sampling different cultures (and food !).









Before researching statistical and computational methods in epidemiology at Princeton University, I earned a PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience and a MSc in Complexity Science at the University of Warwick. 

I am the founder and organizer of the award-winning Advanced Topics on Machine learning ( ATOM ) discussion group in Seattle. Whilst at Princeton, I founded the Princeton University Python Community, and taught workshops on scientific computing for the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering. 

My interests are in applied mathematics, signal and image processing, and machine learning.
