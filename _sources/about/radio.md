# Amateur radio

I'm an active amateur radio operator, callsign K7DRQ.

On the HF bands, I exclusively operate CW (Morse code), either from my home station or with a portable setup, in parks or on beaches.

I'm also active on local VHF; I serve as Secretary of the Board for the [Puget Sound Repeater Group](https://web.psrg.org/), and I run the Nine O'clock Net every Sunday morning.

I love to think about antenna design, and have written code that implements antenna optimisation using genetic algorithms; this has resulted in a few very quirky-looking antennas that nonetheless work well and have some fairly unique properties.
