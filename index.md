I'm a computer scientist and physicist passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration, learning, and teaching. I'm particularly interested in agriculture tech, the biomedical fields, and any work that can improve our well-being as humans.

I was born in France, and have lived in several different countries. I love reading, mostly fantasy and science fiction, but also philosophy and technical literature. I'm an avid cook and bread baker, and a scotch aficionado. I'm also a [photographer](https://imgur.com/a/wZJT3eN) and [amateur radio operator](https://www.qrz.com/db/K7DRQ).
