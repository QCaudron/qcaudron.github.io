# About Quentin

I'm a passionate scientist with an interdisciplinary, technical background, combining academic curiosity with industry best practices. I greatly value mentorship and collaborative team-building, creative solutioning, transparency, and personal growth. 


## Professional

Currently, I'm a Senior Manager, Agronomic Data Science with [Sound Agriculture](https://sound.ag). I am working to understand how [SOURCE](https://www.sound.ag/source), a foliar-applied biochemical, can be used to improve crop yields and reduce the need for traditional fertilizers.

Before that, I was a Staff Data Scientist with [Granular](https://granular.ag/). I develop models, informed by remote sensing, that help farmers better manage their operations and adopt more environmentally-friendly practices that sequester carbon (and get paid for it).

Prior to joining Granular, I spent five years at [CBRE](https://cbre.com/), where I lead a team of data scientists working in forecasting revenue scenarios under COVID-19, building a lease abstraction engine, analysing digital user behaviours using unsupervised learning, and bringing modern computational methods to engineers and stakeholders alike.


## Academic

I attended the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) in the UK, where I graduated with a Bachelors of Chemistry with a minor in Management, with Honours.

After my undergraduate, I then joined the [Centre for Complexity Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/), and earned a Masters in Complexity Science and then a PhD in Computer Science in the field of mathematical neuroscience, under [Dr. Yulia Timofeeva](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~yulia/). I developed algorithms to compute the [filtration properties of dendritic trees](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57056/) as a function of their morphologies. 

I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/)'s [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.princeton.edu/) in [Bryan Grenfell](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/bryan-grenfell)'s group, studying the predictability of epidemics in small populations. During my postdoc, I also created and delivered courses in scientific computing for the [Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/about/about-picscie).

I've also collaborated widely, on things like building image processing algorithms for automated histology, analysing antibiotic consumption, studying malaria transmission dynamics, building remote-sensing hardware for mouse field studies, and evaluating novel deep learning architectures with stochastic outcomes.


## Personal

I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland, Russia, and Canada. I've really enjoyed seeing some beautiful places, experiencing the diverse cultures, and sampling so much great food ! I love traveling, especially into big, natural places and landscapes.

Cooking and baking bread are among my favourite things. I also love gardening and am trying to grow more of my own food. I'm a licensed SCUBA diver and amateur radio operator. I read a lot of fantasy and science fiction. There's nothing better than a quiet evening with a handful of good friends, some home-cooked food, and excellent conversation.
